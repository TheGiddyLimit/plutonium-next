- Fixed tag system clobbering non-5etools tags (notably improving compatibility with the Mastercrafted module)
- Fixed Adventure/Book Importer failing to folderize journals when not using the "Treat Journal Entries as Folders" option

- (Server) Fixed hook usage in custom login sample _[note that this does not require you to make any changes to your backend mod installation]_

- (v10) Race items created by the Race Importer now include race fluff
- (v10) When importing a race to an actor using the Race Importer, an umbrella item is now created for the race, which includes: summary information (ability score improvements, size, speed); fluff; and links to all race feature sheet items created during the import
- (v10) Fixed creatures created by drag-dropping Plutonium actors from Quick Insert using overly-permissive ownership
- (v10) Fixed crash when importing a vehicle upgrade to an actor

## v1.57.0 — "Health Benefits" edition

> 2022-10-22

  - This can be disabled in the new "Integrations (Quick Insert)" Config tab

  - Results respect the Blocklist if in use, and the World Data Source Selector if the "Force Select All for ..." Config option(s) are enabled
  - Homebrew results will appear _if and only if_ a brew is selected in the World Data Source Selector, and the appropriate "Force Select All for ..." Config option is enabled.
- (v10) Improved support for dnd5e 2.0.3

- Fixed folder restyling breaking compendium folders as managed by the Compendium Folders module
- (v10) When dropping a @tag which resolves to Foundry items to a sheet, the referenced entity is no longer imported to the items directory; instead, a temporary import is used, and the item added to the sheet directly

## v1.55.0 — "Tendies" edition

> 2022-09-01

- (v10) Added support. This comes with a variety of changes in the v10 build:
    - Replaced `@EmbedJournalEntry[journal]{displayName}` syntax with `@EmbedUUID[JournalEntry. ... .JournalEntryPage. ...]`. This (much like `@ActorEmbeddedItem`) will work in any text, and if the "Enable Page Embeds" Config option is enabled, embedded pages will be rendered as collapsible inline regions within other pages.
    - Replaced "Enable URL Entries" Config option and associated journal entry context option with custom "Embedded URL" journal entry and journal page sheets. _[Usage of the journal entry version (as opposed to a journal page within a regular Foundry journal entry) is recommended, as Foundry's rendering of journal pages does not allow for maintaining embedded page state when changing page.]_
    - Added "Fast Tooltips" UI Config option, which drastically cuts down the tooltip fade animation duration, and slightly reduces the tooltip activation delay
    - Added "Treat Journal Entries as Folders" Config option. If enabled (the default), journal-entry-creating Importers will treat the final folder path part as a journal entry name, and create pages within that journal as though it were a "folder." For example, when using the default Deity Importer folder path ("Deities") and importing Bane and Tyr, a single journal entry, named "Deities," will be created in the journal root, containing a page for Bane and a page for Tyr. (Subsequent imports will add more pages to the same journal entry, assuming the "folder" path is not changed.)
    - Removed `@Folder[...]` link syntax in favor of built-in `@UUID[Folder. ...]` link syntax
      - Added "Show Folder Linked by @UUID[Folder.] on Click" Config option to allow tabbing/scrolling to a folder and highlighting it on link click
    - Removed `ActorEmbeddedItem[...][...]{...}` link syntax in favor of built-in `@UUID[Actor. ... .Item. ...]` link syntax
      - Added "Roll Items Linked by @UUID[Actor.Item.] on Click" Config option allow actor-owned items to be rolled on link click
    - Added "Show Parent Icon/Name For Child @UUIDs" Config option to add the parent document icon/name to a link to a child document (e.g. `@UUID[Actor.My Character.Item.Big Sword]` will render as `[a][i] My Character / Big Sword` rather than the default `[i] Big Sword`)
    - Added token "Animation Speed" Config option, providing a configurable speed multiplier as an alternative to the "Disable Animations" option
    - Removed adventure/book journal splitting modes in favor of Foundry's built-in journal functionality
- The Creature Importer now sets Monk's Little Details "bloodsplat color" based on creature type
- The Creature Importer now splits out swarm "... if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer." damage as a second item when the "Split Conditional Damage Actions" Config option is enabled
- Fixed SRD effects receiving the wrong `disabled`/`transfer` values when using automation modules

### v1.54.7

> 2022-08-28

- Fixed Importers failing to apply blocklist to specific item variants

### v1.54.6

> 2022-08-28

- Added "Split Conditional Damage Actions" Creature Importer Config option which, when enabled, will split attacks with a conditional damage component ("plus <damage> damage if <condition>") into two separate sheet items; a "Base" item rolling only the base damage, and a "Full" item rolling the base plus conditional damage
- Added warning display/button to Config when Config options which are incompatible with other loaded modules are detected; clicking this button will "fix" the affected Config options, eliminating further console warning spam
- [(v10) Updated v10 version to compatibility with v10 testing 5 (Patron-only, until Foundry v10 stable is released)]

### v1.54.5

> 2022-08-21

- Added "Maintain Images when Overwriting Duplicates" Config option, which maintains the image and token image of a document when overwriting it using the "Update Existing" Importer Duplicate Handling Mode
- Improved Creature Importer detection of damage rolls with no explicit damage type
- Added warning when too many sources have been auto-selected (usually due to a bad "Data Sources" Config setup), with a configurable warning threshold
- Fixed Creature Importer handling of versatile weapons
- Fixed Class Importer double-importing active effects

### v1.54.4

> 2022-08-17

- Tweaked Creature Importer parsing of some attacks (those with multiple ranges; those with multiple different damage rolls) to better support automation modules
- Added support for Spelljammer: Adventures in Space content
- Fixed rare crash on non-string active effect expressions

### v1.54.3

> 2022-08-12

- Creature Importer now classifies "Recharge" attacks as `feature`s rather than `weapon`s, allowing the recharge button to function
- Split "Enable Data Source Filtering" Config option into "player" and "GM" options
- Split Item Importer "Attunement" Config option into "importing to directory" and "importing to actor" parts, to better match the behaviour of the dnd5e system. The default when importing to a directory is now "requires attunement," whereas the default when importing to an actor is "attuned."
- Setting an actor which is already the Rivet import target as the Rivet import target will now un-import-target that actor
- Fixed active effect parser handling of spellcasting bonus expressions (e.g. "+1+1")
- Fixed Item Importer failing to set custom types when using the "Import As <type>" customization
- Fixed Class Importer crash when importing a class which has no subclasses (e.g. a Sidekick class)
- Fixed World Data Source Selector list "select all" checkbox only _visually_ selecting all
- Fixed Class Importer failing to apply filters to descriptions on items imported to directories/compendiums
- Fixed Importers often resetting filters on open (especially first open)

### v1.54.2

> 2022-07-24

- Added "Hide Subclasses in Class Importer" Config option
- Fixed Vehicle Importer failing to set Spelljammer ship token sizes
- _[(v10) Updated v10 version to compatibility with v10 testing 1.1 (Patron-only, until Foundry v10 stable is released)]_

### v1.54.1

> 2022-07-21

- Added Spelljammer support to Vehicle Importer
- Fixed ESC key failing to open game menu after opening a filter window

> 2022-06-29

- Improved the Creature Importer's "Rename To" function
  - Improved acquisition of shortened name from statblock. Additional sentence forms are now supported, as well as names containing dashes (e.g. "The yuan-ti ...").
  - Improved output casing ("The Creature is ..." -> "The creature is ...")
  - Added "Rename To (Short)" field, allowing the creature's "short name" (used when replacing text in actions/etc., and in some auto-generated text) to be specified
  - Improved interaction with the "Secret Attack Descriptions" Config option; previously, the creature's original name would be displayed in generated description text
- Improved sourcing of SRD tokens/portraits when using "Prefer Foundry/System <Tokens|Art>" Config option(s), allowing for the case where an SRD token image is preferred for the token, but a 5etools token image is preferred as the sheet portrait
- Added early check with better error message when libWrapper is missing
- Filter modals now use native Foundry application windows, rather than 5etools-style overlays
- Fixed Level Up failing to pick up subclass items from sheet
- Fixed custom `srd5e.userchar.classes` roll data failing to populate

- Fixed "Open Game Menu" button failing to be added to the Settings tab in some cases _[note that this can be Config'd off as usual]_, and clicking it while the game menu is already open now closes the game menu 
- Fixed junk warning message when modified active effect system attempted to parse an empty dice expression
- (Brew) Added validity check and error messages when attempting to load a brew which has invalid sources; previously, this would either silently fail, or appear to function but cause crashes within Importers
- (Brew) Fixed race condition resulting in infinite loading screen when attempting to load certain brew dependency structures
- _[(v10) Added initial v10-compatible version (Patron-only, until Foundry v10 stable is released)]_

### v1.52.3

> 2022-06-06

- Added "Enabled, but Use 99 Slots" spell points Config option. This avoids setting all spells to "At Will," while preventing you from running out of slots, making organisation easier and providing better compatibility with other modules/sheets.
- Fixed Race Importer crash when importing a race which does not have a subrace
- Fixed Optional Feature importer crash when importing to a directory/compendium
- Fixed Item Importer failing to fully set ranges from SRD
- Fixed infinite prompt cycle when drag-dropping an item which has a replacement in a "replacement data compendiums," when that replacement was also imported by Plutonium

### v1.52.2

> 2022-06-02

- Fixed crash when importing an actor to a compendium
- Fixed Class Importer sheet item drag-drop handler killing other event handlers
- Fixed scaling "dice" of flat-number spells (e.g. Aid)
- Fixed rare case where a spell imported from an "additional spells" list could have a broken saving throw

### v1.52.1

> 2022-06-01

- Fixed console spam due to over-eager destruction of missing HP display HUD elements

## v1.52.0 — "Scrub Up" edition

> 2022-06-01

- Added libWrapper as a hard dependency. Previously, the libWrapper shim was included and relied upon as a fallback if the module itself was not present. This has been phased out in favor of relying on the full module, allowing Plutonium to make better use of libWrapper's features.
- When opening the Import Wizard, the "Open Importer" button is now focussed, allowing you to hit enter to quickly open the active importer
- When opening an Importer, the search field is now focussed. Hitting enter will import the topmost list item.
- Advancements are now briefly suppressed when drag-dropping a Plutonium-imported class/subclass item to sheet, allowing the Class Importer to catch and handle the drop event. This prevents 20th-level classes being imported without prompting when drag-dropping a class item to a sheet. Note that older Plutonium-imported class/subclass items may have an incomplete set of flags, and should be re-imported to fully re-enable "import on drag-drop" functionality.
- Added option to display missing token health beneath token, rather than as an overlay. This option is force-enabled if running Levels, as a workaround for Levels displaying tokens above the overlay in some cases.
- Added the option to choose creature size to the "Create Named Token" macro
- Folder paths are now sorted alphabetically in the Import Wizard "Folder Path" selector
- Fixed Creature Importer failing to set correct token dimensions in some cases (notably, when an import overwrites an existing creature)
- Fixed Creature Importer failing to set correct spellcasting info in some cases (notably, when an import overwrites an existing creature)
- Fixed Background Importer resetting unused characteristics fields during import
- Fixed discrepancies between Class Importer class/subclass identifier generation and dnd5e's identifier generation
- Fixed regression where `srd5e.userchar.classes` object was missing from `srd5e.userchar` object
- Fixed regression where hover+DEL failed to delete measured templates, lights, etc.
- Fixed Creature Importer crash when attempting to add a weapon from a replacement data compendium to a creature
- Fixed Item Importer merging an item into an existing stack of items which have a different item type
- Fixed Importers failing to combine proficiency + expertise from the same feature in some cases
- Fixed Class & Subclass Feature Importer double-adding page number to feature source
- Fixed Spell Importer failing to correctly set spell point resource usage when using spell points
- Fixed Class Importer prompting to import all wizard spells when importing the wizard class to an actor
- Fixed over-zealous wiping of HUD elements when adjusting HUD font size, which was breaking compatibility with Hover Distance (if not others)
- Fixed Equipment Shop "Class Starting Gold" Config option adding the gold to _all_ shop instances, rather than only those opened by the Class Importer
- (Brew) Fixed Race Importer failing to load base race addon data when importing a subrace
- (Brew) Fixed rare case where additional proficiencies from a subclass could be ignored

## v1.51.0 — "Boxcraft" edition

> 2022-05-08

- Added "Rectangular Select ..." tools to scene Measurement Controls, Lighting Controls, and Ambient Sound Controls, and made the "Select Notes" tool support standard click-drag box select
- Added "Replacement Data Compendiums" Config option to Item/Spell Importers. If populated, the importer will check the compendiums provided for an existing version of an item/spell during import, and use the existing version if it finds one. This effectively allows e.g. spells imported to creature statblocks by the Creature Importer to be customized, or starting items imported by the Class Importer to be customized.
- Setting a creature's token URL to a path ending in "*" (i.e., a wildcard) during the "Customize Import" phase of the Creature Importer will now correctly set the token "Randomize Wildcard Images" value for that creature
- Added "Class Starting Gold" Equipment Shop Config option, which allows the GM to set a fixed value of starting gold to be used for purchasing starting equipment, instead of using the value set by the class
- Added "Open Last Used Importer (<entityType>)" as bindable hotkey option (functionally identical to clicking the "heart" button in a directory)
- Added "Select Existing Folder Path" dropdown to Importer "Folder Path" UI
- Fixed Supernatural Gifts & Rewards imports crashing
- Fixed Spell Importer crashing when "Auto-Detect Actor Spell Preparation Mode" option is enabled
- Removed unnecessary URL encoding of various image URLs, notably those used in the Map Importer
- Fixed table rolls of the form `9x-0` failing to convert to `9x-100` in some cases
- Fixed Adventure/Book Importers importing inline content (tables) multiple times

### v1.50.1

> 2022-05-02

- Fixed crash when importing spells/opening the Spell Importer

## v1.50.0 — "Systemic Advancement" edition

> 2022-05-01

- Migrated system support to dnd5e 1.6.x
  - Note that dnd5e 1.5.x is **no longer supported**.
  - Note that Foundry v0.8.x is **no longer supported** either, as dnd5e 1.6.x requires Foundry v9+.
  - Hit points/hit dice in advancements are not *yet* supported, but this may come in the future, if/when class items support more hit dice formats. Until then, the Class Importer will continue to set hit points/hit dice as it has always done.
  - Features in advancements are not fully supported, and this is unlikely to change in the future, as importing features on-the-fly is preferable for a variety of reasons. The Class Importer will track imported features using advancements, allowing these to be easily removed when down-levelling, but levelling up should still be done via the Class Importer (or Charactermancer!).
- Imported Optional Features may now import other Optional Features (e.g. the "Superior Technique" fighting style may now import Battle Master Maneuvers)
- Converted all remaining "5etools-style" modal windows to Foundry applications, for a more consistent UI
- Fixed Class Importer failing to load all available spells when prompting to add cantrips/fill spellbook
- Fixed crashes around/rendering of @quickref tags
- Token vision is now more consistently set across Creature Importer and Race Importer (with the former gaining better support for metric, and the latter gaining support for all truesight/tremorsense) 

### v1.49.4

> 2022-04-21

- Fixed various issues caused by Item Importer over-zealously matching SRD compendium items (e.g. converting "Arrow +3" to "Arrow" for the purposes of finding stats and/or stacking with existing sheet items) 
- (v9) Fixed crash when importing creatures with Midi QOL active
- (Brew) Fixed Class Importer crash on malformed starting gold expression

### v1.49.3

> 2022-04-19

- Optional Feature and Feat Importers may now set senses (darkvision, blindsight, etc.)
- Race Importer may now set more sense types [mainly for homebrew]
- Added Config options to convert race speeds to metric

- Fixed Class/Subclass Feature Importer adding some active effects twice
- Fixed Spell Importer failing to apply class filter when opening on caster sheet
- (Brew) Added support for alternate tokens using `tokenUrl`

### v1.49.2

> 2022-04-03

- Fixed crash when attempting to import a background

### v1.49.1

> 2022-04-02

- Improved Creature Importer support for "PB" in dice expressions
- The Creature Importer now optimistically parses partially-numerical saving throw values (similar to the current best-effort parsing for HP and AC)
- Added popout buttons to Importer windows
- Added inline "Preview" and "Import" to Maps Importer list
- Popout windows will now use the width/height of the app's window, where available, rather than a default pre-set value
- Reworked drag-drop of background, class/subclass, and race items to drastically reduce the amount of junk data stored in flags, and fix crashes triggered by drag-dropping some imported homebrew items
- Reworked Psionic Importer to share more standardised Importer internals; this _should_ increase the reliability and preciseness of its parsing!
- "Display Missing Health" text is now hidden for a token when that token is converted to a "blood splat" by the Monk's Little Details module
- Fixed Psionic Importer failing to consistently display discipline mode names with the inclusion of point cost, concentration, etc.
- (v9) Switched from `Text` to `PreciseText` when rendering missing token health, fixing the blurriness
- (Brew) Fixed Creature Importer crash when importing some formats of `"type": "list"`

## v1.49.0 — "Bug Hunt" edition

> 2022-03-23

- Improved Creature Importer handling of multi-part versatile dice (e.g. "1d10 slashing damage plus 1d6 cold damage")
- An additional image loader has been added to serve the "Save Imported Images/Tokens to Server" Config option, to bypass CORS issues when loading tokens/images from some URLs. This loader requires the backend mod to be installed in order to function.
- Added UI Config option to suppress "Missing roll data" warning notifications 
- Fixed Item Importer crash when attempting to stack items with the "Use Strict Entity Matching" Config option enabled
- Fixed inversion of source selection screen "Select All" checkbox states
- Fixed Trap Importer crashing when trying to import
- (Brew) Expanded `foundry<X>` usage
  - More entity types (hopefully, all of them!) will now load/respect `foundry<X>` `effects`, `flags`, and `data`
  - Effect flags, duration, etc. may now be specified
- (v9) Fixed use of outdated scene progress bar API crashing various tools
- (Server) Added generic binary data fetching endpoint (used as a workaround for loading troublesome tokens; see above)

### v1.48.4

> 2022-03-16

- Fixed Class Importer failing to apply blocklist to spellcaster cantrip/prepared spell lists
- Fixed Config compatibility overrides being applied too late for players
- (v9) Fixed included compendium name containing a `.`, rendering it useless in the latest Foundry version

### v1.48.3

> 2022-03-10

- Improved detection of reaction/per-rest feature data
- Fixed Adventure/Book importer failing to open
- Fixed player Config resetting on reload

### v1.48.2

> 2022-03-10

- Added "Select Class Sources" screen to "Add New Class" flow of Level Up button, allowing e.g. homebrew classes to be selected when adding a new class
- Fixed "current uses" being set to 0 when importing "innate" additional spells
- Fixed Class Importer always choosing the first set of additional spells when adding spells from subclasses
- Fixed "Fix ESC Key" Config option throwing an error when ESC is pressed with no active canvas
- Fixed Item Importer failing to set correct ACs for some magical SRD items
- Fixed Background Importer crash when cancelling feature import
- Fixed Level Up button being added to sheet twice in rare cases
- (v9) Fixed "Compact Chat" Config option setting chat font size to a fixed value, breaking the application of Foundry's "Font Size" slider
- (v9) Removed "Delete" chat message context option, as this is now part of Foundry
- (v9) Fixed Rivet failing to display rolls in chat

### v1.48.1

> 2022-02-27

- Fixed Item Importer crashing when importing some items

## v1.48.0 — "Dragon Drop" edition

> 2022-02-26

- Added drag-drop functionality:
  - Importer list items may now be drag-dropped to text areas; sheets; sidebars; compendiums; and the canvas
  - `@<tag>[...]`s may now be drag-dropped to text areas; sheets; sidebars; compendiums; and the canvas
    - Note that drag-dropping `Item`-typed entities to the canvas currently requires module support to function, e.g. the Item Piles module _[requires Item Piles v1.5.0+]_
- Loot Generator drag-drop to canvas now uses Item Piles where available _[requires Item Piles v1.4.6+]_
- Added token selection/customization to Creature Importer's "Customize Import" screen (previously the "Scale CR"/etc. screen)
- Improved Creature Importer parsing of various list-style actions (eye rays, "choose"/"random" actions, etc.), including the generation of a parent action in which all the options are listed/linked
- Item Importer filters now hide "Generic Variant" items by default, and show "Specific Variant" items instead
- Improved item image finding in Item Importer, allowing fallback on base items/basic items for magic items/specific variants
- The Item Importer now tries to parse and add various weapon "additional damage" dice/types
- Added "School" as Spell Importer folder option
- Active effect config options are now forcibly set to Midi QOL-compatible values when Midi QOL is running
- Split "Metric" Importer Config options into "Distance/Speed" and "Weight" options, to better support the system-wide metric weight option. Additionally, when the system-wide metric weight option is enabled, metric weights will always be used by the Importer.
- Fixed Class Importer application of tool proficiencies; previously, proficiencies would be added to the "Special" free-text input, instead of ticking the appropriate box
- Fixed Class Importer setting `undefined` level requirements for imported optional features
- Fixed Loot Generator items failing to import when Importer "Skip duplicates" Duplicate Handling Mode is enabled
- Fixed Importer trying to create folders as a player in some rare cases

- Fixed Class & Subclass/Class & Subclass Feature Importers inserting broken links when a feature has been filtered out
- (v9) Improved compatibility with Token Magic FX module [note that this is probably still broken in v0.8.x; sorry, legacy users!]
- (v9) Fixed journal entries directory failing to compact when the "Compact Journal Entries" UI Config option is enabled

### v1.47.3

> 2022-02-03

- Fixed Creature Importer duplicating creature items in rare cases
- Fixed "Base Site URL" Import Config Option failing to apply to image URLs

> 2022-01-30

- Fixed World Content Blocklist failing to blocklist subclasses
- (v9) Fixed "number"-type active effects no longer applying their values in v9.245
- (v9) Fixed incompatibility with Better Rolltable
- (Added Manifest+ conflict info)

> 2022-01-26

- Fixed Importer failing to read custom files/URLs
- Fixed Class Importer failing to respect World Content Blocklist class entries
- Fixed rendering of long strings in Config string pickers
- (v9) Fixed "Delete Message" showing twice in chat message context menus; renamed to "Delete" to match Foundry standard 
- (Server; v0.4.2) (v9) Fixed crash when running in the Electron client _without_ the """optional""" Electron addon

## v1.47.0 — "Is It On the List?" edition

> 2022-01-23

- Added "World Data Source Selector" tool. This allows the GM to curate the list of sources which are available (if the new Data Source "Enable Data Source Filtering" Config option is enabled) throughout the module (Importers, Actor Polymorpher, etc.)
  - Added "Force Select All for <Players|GMs>" Data Source Config option, which ensures that all available sources are selected throughout the module. Note that this _can_ be used without the "Enable Data Source Filtering" Config option recommended, to forcibly select _every_ available source, although this is not recommended for performance reasons. With these options are enabled, source selection screens will be silently skipped where possible.
- Added "World Content Blocklist" tool; this is a port of the 5etools Blocklist, and works similarly
- Added "Importer Image Preloader" tool, which finds and downloads all images available in the current version of the site to your Config'd "Image/Token Directory" [this aims to be equivalent to downloading the (long-dead) images zip and manually creating an `img` from it]
- The Import Wizard "Open Default Importer" buttons are now "Open Last-Used Importer" buttons, which will open the importer using the previous selection of sources made. If the "Force Select All" Data Source Config option(s) are enabled, this will instead open the importer with all sources selected.
- (v9) Added "Import All" option to compendium title menu [this is the same functionality as a regular right-click -> import all]
- Added drag-and-drop support for list items in Creature, Objects, and Vehicles Importers. Dropping a list item to the canvas imports the dropped entity, and creates a token for it at the drop point. Note that setting the "Duplicate Handling Mode" Importer Config option to "Skip Duplicates" is highly recommended when using this feature!
- Added "Delete Message" context menu option to chat messages
- Tweaked/improves various UI elements, notably adding missing red coloring for various "delete" buttons
- Parallelized loading of homebrew in various source selection apps, greatly improving performance when loading many homebrew files
- Fixed various Importers downloading item images during item pre-load step, causing _all_ item images to be downloaded
- Fixed Spell Importer treating non-feet units as feet when applying metric conversions
- The Level Up sheet button now prefers the most-recently-released non-UA version of a class when trying to determine the actor's classes, if no previous import data is present
- Importer metric conversion now round to a max of 3 decimal places
- Fixed Tidy5e Sheet "dark"-compatible styling being applied to non-sheet apps
- Improved custom actor active effect error handling; more information (such as the affected actor's name/ID) is now logged, to (hopefully) assist debugging
- (Server; v0.4.1) (v9) Added optional Electron addon, to enable popout windows when running inside the Electron app (although this is still not recommended!)

## v1.46.0 — "Resources, Online" edition

> 2022-01-14

- Added "resource" handling to Class Importer, which can create and/or make use of sheet items for resources (such as Ki, Sorcery Points, and Superiority Dice) when importing features. Features which consume resources (e.g. a Monk's "Flurry of Blows") may then link their resource consumption to the appropriate resource sheet item.
- Class Importer now creates links between sheet items when splitting a single feature (e.g. "Ki") into a parent and multiple sub-features (e.g. "Ki", "Flurry of Blows", ...), such that the child features can be accessed via `@ActorEmbeddedItem` from the parent
- Improved Class Importer SRD icon matching for various features, including spellcasting and channel divinity
- Various Importers will now default to "special" activation cost for items which have e.g. limited uses and no specific action cost, to avoid other information being automatically hidden by the item UI
- Added "Reset All Settings" button to Config
- Added `@ActorEmbeddedItem` tag generation when drag-dropping an actor's sheet item to a text editor
- Fixed `@Folder` links breaking text rendering for player who did not have access to the linked folder  
- (Brew) `"img"` may now be used in `"foundry<Property>"` objects, and will set the Foundry "img" field (usually the icon) of the appropriate document on import
- (Brew) Fixed Class/Subclass Feature Importer, Rewards Importer, and Psionics Importer failing to add custom flags when specified in e.g. `"foundryFlags"`
- (Brew) Fixed various `"foundry<Property>"` types failing to be properly applied, as the importer did not consider them valid
- (Brew) Fixed Importer parsing of `@damage` tags failing to account for display text
- (Enabled Rivet import for classes)

### v1.45.1

> 2022-01-05

- Added "sheet item" and "custom" modes to Import (Psionic) Config "Psi Points Resource" option, to bring it in line with the Spell Importer
- Way of the Four Elements Monk Elemental Disciplines which add spells now link the use/charge consumption of those spells to your Ki sheet item (where available)
- (v9) Fixed crash when loading with Permission Viewer enabled
- (Brew) Fixed homebrew subraces crashing the importer

## v1.45.0 — "I'll Take One Lift" edition

> 2022-01-04

- Added school-based default spell icons to Spell Importer, for spells which lack an existing icon
- The Creature Importer now optimistically parses more non-numerical ACs, and avoids using `ac.base` in calculations (which caused the AC editor window to display an incorrect value)
- Added sound clip import to Creature Importer when "Monk's Little Details" module is active

### v1.39.4

- Added "Import (Spells)" Config option to "Auto-Detect Actor Spell Preparation Mode", which makes the Spell Importer attempt to create a spell with a preparation mode appropriate to the spellcasting type of the actor it is being imported to, e.g. Pact Magic for Warlocks
- Added support for "@Folder[...]{...}" tags (similar to Foundry's existing "@Actor[...]{...}, etc.", which, when clicked, will switch to the tab the folder is in, expand it, and scroll to it (and provides a brief flare animation to mark the folder)

- Added SHIFT-click to Importer list inline preview buttons, which previews fluff info (where available)
- Added fine-grained permission Config options for all Plutonium-added tools
- Added metric support for ranges to Item Importer, and for token vision ranges to Creature/Object/Vehicle Importers

> 2021-09-13

- Added Config setting to specify Importer image/token assets directory

- Added "Prefer Foundry/System Images" and "Prefer Foundry/System Tokens" Config options, which set the preferred order in which images and tokens should be sourced

- Item Importer now classifies more bonus-providing items as "equipment" instead of "loot"
- Reworked Polymorpher to import a temporary actor to the Actors directory before applying it to the chosen sheet. This ensures AC calculations are correct, and should be a more robust method for ensuring all sheet values are correctly applies as the dnd5e system evolves. [The downside of this, is that crashes/bugs can now leave a junk actor in your directory, so if that happens, please report it as a bug!]
- Added "Class Level" scaling support to Creature Importer "Scale and Rename" screen, for various (mainly) TCE creatures
- Added support for `@class[...]` tags

- Table Importer now converts all `@tag`s, rather than only those that take up a full table row
- Creature Importer now adds links from any "Legendary Actions" feature to the creature's legendary actions. This is achieved by way of a custom `@ActorEmbeddedItem` syntax, which functions much like Foundry's `@Actor` syntax, but with two "name/ID" parts instead of one.

- Added Config option allowing additional local homebrew files to be specified (beyond those listed in `homebrew/index.json`)
- Added Config option to force Importer to render dice as plain text (e.g. "1d6") instead of inline rollers (e.g. "[[/r 1d6]]")

  - The Vehicle Importer now sets land, air, and water types
  - The Class Importer now sets available class proficiencies on imported class items
  - Importers now break down weapon proficiencies, and some tool proficiencies, into their respective individual types. [Notably in need of improvement is the handling of tools and tool proficiencies. This requires a major overhaul of various Plutonium systems and 5etools' data (and, by extension, homebrew), which would otherwise have significantly delayed this update. More to come Soon:tm:.]
- Added `homebrew` directory, from which homebrew is automatically loaded by appropriate Importers
- Added a "Variants" dropdown to the Creature Importer's "Import with ..." dialogue. This currently only lists "Dragons as Innate Spellcasters" variants, but will be expanded in future to allow other variant creature imports.
- Fixed drag-drop "Use Importer?" prompt not appearing for actions, backgrounds, conditions/diseases, cults/boons, races, and spells

- Fixed Spell Importer using different icons between sheet items and active effects
- Fixed Creature Importer not converting `@tag`s to Plutonium equivalents in biographies
- Fixed Importer crash when importing journal entries or rollable tables to compendiums when "Duplicate Handling Mode" is set to None
- Fixed compatibility with Permission Viewer module [for the moment; unsure if the module itself is working as intended, or if the incompatibility is a symptom of a minor UI bug]
- (0.8.x) Fixed Bulk Prototype Token Editor setting junk "Display Name" and "Display Bars" values

## v1.33.0 — "Enhanced Coverage" edition

> 2021-07-18

- Added rudimentary "Actions", "Languages", "Cults & Supernatural Boons," and "Other Character Creation Options" importers [these are primarily useful in that they teach the importer how to handle `@action`, `@language`, ... `@tag`s, fixing various "broken" links]
- Fixed the Class & Subclass Feature Importer failing to handle clicking on `@classFeature` and `@subclassFeature` `@tag`s
- Re-implemented Adventure/Book Importer duplicate handling [previously disabled as it was incompatible with fine-grained section splitting]
- Fixed rare case where Importer could fail to detect existing folder with a given name if the name was numeric
- Fixed hovering skill/sense names failing to show a hover window (especially in 0.8.x)

### v1.32.4

- (0.8.x) Fixed crash when loading with "Disable Game Canvas" Foundry setting enabled

### v1.32.1

> 2021-07-11

- Fixed journal entries failing to load when containing certain @tags
- Fixed case where a hover window could become stuck open

## v1.32.0 — "The Boring Stuff" edition

> 2021-07-11

- Added Config option to prefer rendering links as `@<tag>[...]`s, which is now the default. This means that, instead of rendering links to 5etools, Foundry-like actor/item/etc. document links will be rendered instead.
- Note that these are not _true_ Foundry document links, and, as such, there's magic going on behind the scenes to make them behave sensibly. If anything is missing, or doesn't quite work how you'd expect, do let me know.
- Added a config option to enable 5etools-link-like hover capabilities to these fake Foundry document links [disabled by default, as I found it felt more annoying than helpful]
- Added Config option to split imported adventure/book content "by contents" or "by heading," as opposed to the default/existing "by chapter"

- Added cantrip selection step to Class Importer for spellcaster classes

- Added Export/Import buttons to Config Editor, which allow the entire config to be exported/imported between games
- Added Spell Importer option to import as spell scrolls when importing to a directory/compendium (previously, this was limited to spells imported directly to actors)
- Restored the Package Importer's ability to import worlds [as I have been informed that there should no longer be any scary copyright-infringing core worlds in the package index]
- Fixed import de-duper handling of existing content when importing temporary entities
- Fixed (harmless) error when SHIFT-clicking an actor `@<tag>[...]` link as a user with insufficient permissions to create actors
- Fixed various subclass/race/background/etc. sources missing from spells, especially for homebrew
- Fixed rare scene crash on "missing health" display trying to de-reference non-existent tokens
- Deferred Creature Importer metadata loading until after main module load, to improve performance, and allow the error to be handled gracefully (instead of locking you out of e.g. the Config)
- Fixed Config Editor failing to correctly reset/display reset state of empty strings
- Fixed Background Importer crashing when trying to process @item tags in default starting equipment display text
- Fixed rare text mangling when rendering embedded journal entries
- (Brew) Fixed Class Importer failing to de-dupe classes in list views when loading homebrew subclasses
- (Brew) Fixed Creature Importer crashing on poorly-formatted actions

- Removed built-in compendiums

- Fixed Config returning junk data in even rarer cases (the _real_ source of recent "bad permissions" errors on import)
- Fixed Level Up button "Add New Class" option adding all subclasses

- Reworked Psionic Importer to import as features instead of spells

 - This has been split out of the Class/Subclass importer, and sports a variety of improvements to the way additional data (proficiencies, damage imm./res./vuln., condition immunities, spells granted) are handled

## v1.28.0 — "Eldritch Horrors" edition

> 2021-05-01

- Added Plutonium-specific flags to data available in roll formulas for sheet items. This is currently limited to the item's name, which can be accessed as `@name`, or as `@srd5e.name.<whitespace/etc.-stripped item name>`. This enables, for example, the following (quite hideous) expression for Agonizing Blast bonus damage: `+(@srd5e.name.eldritchblast ? @abilities.cha.mod : 0)`.
- Optional Feature importer now imports additional spells, as specified by a given feature. For example, importing "Armor of Shadows" will add an at-will "Mage Armor" spell to your sheet.

- Added rudimentary Vehicle Upgrade importer
- Added rudimentary Object importer
- Improved Importer activation/uses parsing, to hopefully set more activation/use info on created features
- Reworked how Config options are handled if conflicting modules are detected; an auto-disabled option is now greyed out, and has a tooltip which provides info on which module is producing the conflict (this information is also logged to the console as a warning)
- Disabled the "Auto-Roll Multiattacks" Config option if Midi QOL is detected, as the two are no longer compatible
- Improved Multiattack Roller parsing, reducing some cases of excess rolling
- Reworked compendium generation method, to better handle (i.e. bypass, because they break things) active effects
- Fixed filter window appearing under modal window when selecting "additional spells" during imports, requiring the latter to be closed before the former could be accessed

- Added support for "Customizing a Background" rules to the Background Importer
- The Spell Importer can now import spells as spell scrolls when importing to an actor. To do so, use the "Import as Spell Scroll(s)" button at the bottom of the importer's spell list.
- Added system version check as part of startup, which warns you when your version of dnd5e (if you're using dnd5e) is older than Plutonium expects [currently, it doesn't warn if your version is too new, but this might change once I begin tinkering with 0.8.x; Soon:tm:]
- Added Config option to prefix Adventure/Book Importer journal entries with a "sort order prefix," which is a short alphanumeric tag that should be friendly to both Foundry's default directory sorting, and any modules that do alphabetical directory sorting
- Journal entries created by the Adventure/Book Importer now specify sort ordering, to better preserve their sort order between reloads
- Creature Importer now adds "Special Equipment" items to creature statblocks during import
- Added "Download Image" button to Art Browser images (as an alternative to "Copy URL"), which will download the image to your current "User Art Directory" (as defined in the Config). Note that this requires the backend mod to function. [No changes were made to the backend mod, so if you already have it installed, you do not need to update it to benefit from this functionality.]
- Fixed Item Importer crashing when active effect population disabled
- Dice expressions containing multiplication/division signs are now correctly converted to "*" and "/"
- Improved active effect system error detection; processing all actors will no longer fail due to one broken actor, and any individual broken actors will now log their IDs to console

- Fixed Class Importer inflating ability scores when applying ASIs, in the case where the actor has active effects which increase their ability scores
- (Regenerated compendiums)

- Spell Importer now imports effects from the SRD where available

- Race Importer now uses race/base race image as a fallback when importing race features, reducing the number of features which are imported with a default Plutonium image

- When opening the Creature Importer for a specific, official, adventure source, the red "Adventure NPC" filter will be automatically removed
- Added Creature Importer Config option to append CR/type "tag" suffixes to creature names on import
- Added a "re-open last used importer" button to the "Plutonium Import" button at the top of relevant directories

- Improved compatibility with Drag Upload; some meaningless errors thrown by the Art Browser are now squashed if it is detected
- Improved compatibility with Obsidian module; importing items with active effects should no longer brick your sheet
- Fixed Creature Importer attempting to create active effects for ACs when importing to compendiums; as compendiums do not (yet?) cleanly support active effects, the AC is now instead imported as a static value

> 2021-02-15

- Added active effect generation to Item Importer for damage resistance/immunity/vulnerability and condition immunity
- Improved Item Importer and Creature Importer DAE compatibility (and as such, removed warning notifications when both are active)
- Improved active effect config UI tweaks, by adding a "Priority" field and improving the visuals. The Config option to enable/disable the tweaks has been renamed to "Expand Active Effect Config."
- Innately cast spells imported by the Race Importer are now imported with their appropriate casting level baked in (for example, a Tiefling's Hellish Rebuke is now set to 3d10 fire damage rather than 2d10). [The dnd5e sheet doesn't allow casting level to be chosen for innate spells, so the damage roll was always missing a die. This "workaround" may be removed if this changes in future.]
- In the Class Importer, a special "Unarmed Strike" weapon is now created when importing the Monk class
- The Class Importer can now create active effects for increased movement speed; this is currently used to create an Unarmored Movement effect for Monk, and a Fast Movement effect for Barbarian
- The Class Importer now creates "Unarmored Defense" active effects

## v1.22.0 — "Better Late than Never?" edition

> 2021-02-10

- Added Config option to populate item (as in, 5e items, not Foundry items) active effects on import
- Added Config option to use alternate active effect calculations, which support Foundry's roll "@variable" syntax (familiar for any DAE users)
- Added warning message when DAE is enabled, and automatic disable for some features which are known to cause conflicts (the two mentioned above, as well as the extra "Active Effect Attribute Key Helper" button shown when configuring active effects)

### v1.21.1

- (Compatibility/syncing with 5etools filter fix)

## v1.21.0 — "Auspicious" edition

> 2021-02-06

- Tweaked Importer list styling, adding borders and on-hover highlights to improve visual clarity
- Added "Find Active Effect Attribute Key" button to rows in "Effects" tab of Configure Active Effect windows. This brings up a list of (hopefully) all available active effect attribute keys for the actor/item effect you're configuring. For those of you who use DAE, this is similar to the dropdown it provides for quickly selecting a key. As such, Plutonium's version  can be disabled in the Config for UI. [This was added mainly for my own benefit as I explore Active Effects, and may not be a permanent fixture]
- Improved Starting Equipment/Equipment Shop UI, adding better visual hinting when gold has been rolled, and adding more navigation options
- Improved compatibility with the Forien's Quest Log module
- Improved Spell Importer dice parsing
- Fixed Background Importer off-by-one error when rolling for characteristics
- Fixed Equipment Shop failing to load its saved and/or default item list
- Fixed Equipment Shop failing to correctly set an actor's currency on confirming a transaction
- Fixed Package Importer list highlighting when clicking between selections
- Fixed Item Importer splitting "atomic" collections of items (e.g. "Bag of Ball Bearings (1,000)") into their constituent items on import. If you still wish to import 1,000 individual Ball Bearing items, a Config option has been provided to disable this new behaviour.
- Fixed Race Importer double-applying skill proficiencies in some cases 
- Added Rivet support for routePrefix'd game URLs [this update should have already been live in the Chrome and Firefox extension stores for some time]
- (Added Rivet source to download)

- Added stub Plutonium settings to Foundry's "Module Settings" tab, with a button to open the main Plutonium Config

- Fixed various Importer UI bugs (e.g. Polymorph importer's buttons saying "Import" instead of "Select")
- Fixed Creature Importer failing to locate sheet item icons (and slightly expanded those that it can locate, besides)
- Fixed "expanded spell list" spells (i.e. Warlock subclass lists) importing as innate/always prepared spells
- Fixed Multiattack Roller infinitely looping when detecting a "multiattack" action within the clicked multiattack action, and improved detection of some action types
- Widened initial Art Browser window on narrow screens, to avoid hiding UI

## v1.19.0 — "Come Kill Me, I'm Verified" edition

> 2021-01-11

- Added popout (to new window) buttons to popped-out sidebar tabs (e.g. Combat Tracker)
- Added warning message when probably about to delete a non-transformed actor after a player clicks the "Restore Transformation" button on a transformed actor. Root cause of this behaviour still unknown.
- Vehicle Importer now sets the actor's speeds to a reasonable interpretation of the vehicle's speed, within the restrictions of the sheet
- Fixed Vehicle Importer crash on parsing certain speed types

- Improved Item Importer's classification of items as "equipped" or "not equipped," now providing a reasonable guess based on item type
- Fixed Compact Chat hiding skill names
- Fixed Compact Chat incorrectly hiding headers in some cases
- (Verified compatibility with dnd5e v1.2.2)

### v1.18.1

> 2021-01-03

- Overhauled Importer "Additional Spells" UI, used when races, feats, or subclasses provide additional spells during
- Fixed a piece of flawed library code which had introduced about ten very subtle, but very nasty, bugs. The effect of these bugs was to either reduce import performance, or to partially delete to-be-imported data in some rare cases.

> 2020-12-29

- Feat Importer can now modify ability scores 
- Feat Importer can now import spells associated with a feat

- All importers will now ask the user for confirmation before modifying an actor's ability scores (previously, no-choice ability score increases would always be applied) 
- Migrated hard-coded "is prepared spellcaster" check in Class Importer to class data, to allow homebrew classes to import spell lists in the future
- Added rudimentary language import step to Class Importer, which currently ensures Druids learn Druidic, and Rogues learn Thieves' Cant. This will be expanded in future to support subclasses (e.g. Draconic Sorcerer), and learning languages at higher levels
- (Fixed issue with package compilation which prevented the previous release from actually releasing)

## v1.17.0 — "Forced to Use a Laptop Screen Over Christmas" edition

> 2020-12-26

- Added UI Config option to "Compact Chat." This hides the author header for messages from an author after their first (within a time limit), to mimic the functionality of most modern chat apps. This, unfortunately, hides the "delete" button, so you can hold down SHIFT while hovering over a message to reveal the header.
- Improved Starting Equipment UI to allow items to be purchased with gold while also gaining default starting equipment. This is useful in cases where you already have a gold amount entered into a sheet (e.g. from a background), and add class levels afterwards.

### v1.16.1

> 2020-12-09

- (Server; v0.2.0) Added package importer, replacing the previously-default Foundry importer (removed in Foundry 0.7.8). Note that this was removed from Foundry due to security concerns; install the backend mod at your own risk.
- When attempting to install a package via the Package Importer, if the modded backend is not detected, a list of manifest links will be presented for the user to manually install via Foundry's regular "Setup" flow. With the modded backend installed, this functionality can be force-enabled via a config option.
- Fixed Class Importer crashing on missing hit dice (e.g. sidekick classes)
- Fixed Creature Importer failing to recognise some area effect formats (e.g. abominable yeti)

- Creature Importer
  - Sheet items now use SRD compendium art where available

  - "Split" breath weapons (found on e.g. good-aligned dragons) now reference their parent breath weapon, in order to correctly handle charge usage
  - "Eye Ray" actions are now split into one sheet item per ray (rather than the previous single item for all rays)
- Added custom handling when drag-dropping Plutonium-imported items (classes, races, backgrounds) to actor sheets. The UI flow found when importing an item directly to the sheet is now triggered, rather than Foundry's default of creating a sheet item with static information. Note that this change is not retroactive; previously-imported items will drag-drop as before.
- Added rudimentary action/equipment/weapon import to Vehicle Importer
- Improved Multiattack Roller compatibility with Midi QoL
- Added config option to hide "Import" buttons to users below a certain role

- Split Adventure/Book Importer "Configure and Import" UI into two tabs: one for the "classic" importer which pulls actors, items, and journal entries from 5etools; one which attempts to find an available module/world in the above Package Importer tool for the currently selected source. 
- Creature Importer now correctly handles pact magic slots
- Fixed Class Importer default starting equipment failing to combine stacks of items

  - Can now parse saving throws in traits (previously, only actions were checked)
  - Improved parsing of dragon breath weapon attacks, to include targeting information, and splitting multi-modal breath weapons into their individual sub-modes. And, they now have a different icon!
  - No longer skips skill/save bonuses if they aren't a perfect match with expected proficiency/expertise values. It will now instead choose proficient or expertise depending on which is closer to the original score. (Note that this will result in discrepancies between the original creature's skill/save bonus and the imported creature's, which will be ironed out in a future update.)
  - Fixed some cases of parsing damage which must be dealt to the creature as damage the creature can output (e.g. "the grapple can be broken by dealing 6 slashing damage to [the creature]")

- Spell damage data is now loaded from the SRD compendium where available, as this hand-curated data is more reliably correct

> 2020-06-06

- Plutonium is no longer limited (in its manifest) to the "dnd5e" system, and should successfully load under other systems. While it will still contain all the 5e-specific importers and tools, the system-agnostic tweaks and tools should all work.

- Added "Open Default Importer" buttons to Import Wizard, which open the main "5etools" importer with one click
- Improve Race Importer spell handling; spells should now be imported with the correct ability scores and preparation mode
- Made some content matching (i.e. looking for existing class items when levelling up a class) less strict (now matches on only name, as opposed to name + source). Old strict matching is now available as a config option.
- Added config option to avoid splitting item packs when importing items to actors
- Fixed non-attunable magic items being imported as attuned
- Fixed Class Importer failing to fully reset when switching from one source to another

- Added experimental "Enable Journal Embeds" feature. When enabled, this allows you to rightclick a journal item and set an embedded link (Google Doc, YouTube video, etc.) which is then displayed as an embed in that journal entry. Note that this takes up the entire journal entry; any text which might have been in there will be hidden until you remove the embed (same process, but submit an empty URL field).
- Multiattack auto-roller now handles a couple of additional formats
- Fixed Item importer failing when importing to the Items directory
- Fixed gold component values on imported spells

### v0.17.2 — "Sweet Release" edition

- Wondrous items and poisons are now imported to a "Wondrous"/"Poison" folder if folderizing by item type, and no other type info is available
- Adventure/Book importers now pull rollable tables directly from the text, rather than only those linked from the text

- Fixed trusted players being able to see main importer/etc buttons
- Fixed file browser crashes on names containing "%"
- Fixed sheet items (usually, actions of imported creatures) failing to persist in rare cases, and thus disappearing on reload

- Bulk token editor can now set bars to "None" (i.e. empty)

- Creature importer:
  - Weapons wielded by creatures now have additional data pulled in, adding e.g. weight, price, weapon properties, and art (where available)
  - Creatures wearing armor now have this armor added to their inventory
  - Added config option to scale the weight/price of items wielded by larger creatures, based on either the "Barding" rules in the PHB, or on an item from SKT ("Gurt's Greataxe"), these being the only two examples I know of "official" rulings on the matter. Open to suggestions/pointers in the direction of more data.

- Added filters to Actor Feature/Spell Cleaner

## v0.14.0 — "The drugs _do_ work" edition

> 2020-04-19

- Added (albeit highly shitty) Adventure/Book importer, similar to the "legacy" importer available in betteR20
  - Currently doesn't split the text into millions of journal entries; let me know if the "one chapter per entry" approach is better or worse.
  - Currently doesn't have the "next journal entry/previous journal entry" buttons at the top/bottom of each handout; will add these after receiving some feedback on the above.
- Added "Scene creation" as an option for Art Browser drag-drop
- Added Art Browser token sizing config options
- Added config options for Art Browser button placement; it can be made visible under any/all of: the token, tiles, or main scene menus

- Fixed broken "View" link in the Art Browser
- Fixed Art Browser always attempting to leverage the server-side mod, instead of just where available
- (Server) Fixed images failing to upload to an empty assets path

## v0.13.0

> 2020-04-18

- (Compatibility update for 0.5.5)
- Added Art Browser integration, accessible via the "palette" button in the scene controls menu. Features include:
  - Drag-dropping tiles to the canvas, with configurable scaling
  - Drag-dropping tokens to the canvas
  - The ability to download entire image packs locally, provided the server-side mod is installed (more on this below)
- Added server-side mod. Installation instructions can be found in the README. This enables things previously locked out by pesky browser security features, such as downloading images from websites that really don't want you downloading their images (lol). **This is entirely optional, and Plutonium will never _require_ you to mod the Foundry server.** It will, however, enable some additional bells and whistles, like the aforementioned mass image downloader.
- Overhauled module internals/build system. This (hopefully) should not produce a visible difference in functionality, but should fix previous performance penalties incurred by running Plutonium on e.g. large maps with heavy use of dynamic lighting (thanks @ Felix for bringing this to my attention and providing sample data)
- Fixed config "reset tab" button failing to take effect unless the settings were manually changed afterwards
- Relaxed "fast animations" timing to hopefully prevent various timing-related bugs

### v0.12.1

> 2020-04-06

- Overhauled config system to add player layer. This allows each player to change a limited subset of config settings (the editor can be accessed in the Settings tab), including, importantly, the Rivet import target actor
- Added workaround for Bulk Permission Editor wiping pre-existing permissions (I _think_ this is a Foundry bug)
- Added workaround for compendiums being inaccessible in some rare cases (another Foundry bug? Happened in my own game; no errors; couldn't repro it elsewhere)

> 2020-04-04

- Added Bulk Permission Editor tool
- Added folder paths and filtering to Directory Cleaner tool and Bulk Directory Mover tool

- Added "Open Main Menu" button to settings tab when ESC key fix is enabled
- Added "reset tab" buttons to config editor
- Imported classes and class features will now attempt to source art from the SRD compendiums

## v0.11.0

> 2020-04-01

- Added warning prompt when attempting to import a single high level of a class without importing the lower levels, to a sheet without an existing class
- Added warning prompt when attempting to import a subclass (and no class) to a sheet without an existing class
- Exploded class features on import, breaking down e.g. Fighting Style into all its constituent flavours

> 2019-10-29

- Added workaround for a Foundry bug where full art would be used as tokens
- Fixed a bug where items would fail to import
- Fixed some minor layout bugs

### v0.0.3e — "Eat Sleep Code Repeat" edition

> 2019-10-29

- The "import" button should now be available on any sheet, rather than those I manually specify
- The import list "select all" checkbox now only selects/deselects visible rows
- An update to background importing to support multiple features (needed for DIA backgrounds)
- A fix for repeated requests not properly caching data (so opening the same importer repeatedly in the same session should now be quicker)

### v0.0.3d — "A Coat of Red Paint" edition

> 2019-09-22

- Fresh compendium dumps, with Descent Into Avernus content.
- Updated Bestiary files, again to add Descent Into Avernus content.
- A fix for imported creatures always using Strength as their ability score modifier for all their attack rolls. As Foundry doesn't allow the specification of exact to-hit modifiers on NPC attacks, I had completely overlooked this--since 5e statblocks never specify the ability the creature is using for each attack, I'm doing some guesswork behind the scenes to figure it out. It should be accurate in the vast majority of cases, although there appears to be a Foundry bug where creatures can never have their attack proficiency disabled when creating them via the API, so e.g. Ghast's bite is busted.

### v0.0.3c — "Your Wires Are Showing" edition

> 2019-09-16

- A fix for AC sources being a mess of HTML on non-default sheets
- A fix for all the strange numbers appearing down the right-hand-side of import lists
- A fix for the CR Scaler dialogue being a funny size sometimes

### v0.0.3b — "More Than 99 Problems" edition

> 2019-09-14

- A minor compatibility update for Foundry v0.3.(6/7) (with regards to the directory panel layout changes)
- Creature scaling on import
- A fix for creatures disappearing from the combat tracker when they were marked as hidden

### v0.0.3a — "Prune > Dates" edition

> 2019-09-08

- A folder picker UI in the importer, including a (limited) range of "dynamic" options, i.e. if you select "Challenge Rating" in the creature importer, it'll put each creature in a folder according to their CR. Something similar existed in betteR20, although it was nowhere near as customizable--this iteration allows full control. Sadly, Foundry only supports three levels of folder nesting at time of writing, but the developer (Atropos) aims to expand this to at least five.
- A "Prune Folders" option and button in the Directory Cleaner, which can be enabled or run independently to have the cleaner also remove any empty folders it finds.
- A tweak to the included compendiums to add the (abbreviated) source to the name of each item.
- And a few other minor QoL improvements and layout fixes.

### v0.0.2a — "Slightly Higher-Grade Plutonium" edition

> 2019-08-06

- Added workaround for Plutonium sometimes loading after Foundry had already fully initialized, thus causing Plutonium to miss the part where it's supposed to hook into the UI.
- The "Import" button is now kept fixed at the bottom of import list windows.
- Added importer support for Better NPC 5e sheets.
- Added support for Node.js versions as old as version 10 (current is 12), as 10 is the minimum Foundry requires.

- Added weapon bonuses to weapon damage (previously only applied to to-hit).
